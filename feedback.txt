Project Proposal: 3/3

Nice, ambitious project, not much to comment. As a note, the scanner can be
implemented as a Goroutine that delivers symbols to the parser. Each procedure
can in principle be compiled concurrently, although I would be surpirsed if
that gains much speed. Have fun!

Project Artifacts:

Well-done project. In the development statistics, you could include the size
of the Python implementations. Do you have an explanation why Python becomes
more efficient with larger programs, which I find counterintuitive, did you do
some profiling to figure out what is going on? When using Go, did you check
that you are indeed using multiple cores, is GOMAXPROC set correctly? Poster
is nicely designed. Some of the text, in particular the captions of the figures,
is rather small, people shouldn't be needing to get closer to a poster to read
that.
