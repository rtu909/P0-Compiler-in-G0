\section{Project Description}

\subsection{Research Question}

How does the compilation time of the P0 Compiler differ between a sequential implementation and a concurrent implementation using Goroutines in Golang?

\subsection{Documentation} % Raymond - Godoc

For the documentation of our project we will be using GoDoc. GoDoc is similar to documentation 
generators for other programming languages, for example JavaDoc for Java and Doxygen for Python. 
GoDoc generates documentation in PDF or HTML format from comments in the source code. 
Following the standard conventions for GoDoc will provide easily readable source code and good 
documentation for all methods implemented in the P0 Compiler. GoDoc is chosen because it is the standard documentation standard for Golang, 
which is the main programming language we will be using for this project. The conventions for a standard GoDoc comment to generate HTML
 is easy to read, and alone would already provide readable source code to any viewer. 
 In conclusion, GoDoc is intuitive to use and similar to existing documentation standards we have experience with, 
 which makes it the perfect choice for this project.

\subsection{Testing} % Raymond

For testing the correctness of the P0 Compiler in Go, unit testing will be conducted. This unit testing will be done in the standard testing package that is
included in Go. This testing package also includes statement-based code coverage checking that will be useful as a metric for how well the code is tested.
The difference between this package and other standard unit testing for other languages such as PyTest for Python is that it does not utilize assert statements.
Instead an error is thrown after a boolean check coded by the programmer. This will allow the test package to detect multiple errors in the program, because
while an assert statement would stop the program after the first error, the test package in Go will instead detect the error and continue running other test cases.
In conclusion, using the Go test package we can confirm the correctness of our sequential and concurrent implementation in Go before we test the differences in their runtimes
and answer the defined research question.
