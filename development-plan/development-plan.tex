\section{Project Description}

\subsection{Research Question}

How does the compilation time of the P0 Compiler differ between a sequential implementation and a concurrent implementation using Goroutines in Golang?  

\subsection{Relevant Work}

Many compilers forego concurrent compilation of parts of one file for two
reasons.
First, the concurrency mechanisms provided by the languages that other compilers
are coded in have too much overhead.
The time it takes to set up tasks to compile the code concurrently exceeds the
time that could be saved by compiling concurrently.
Next, it is much easier to compile a group of files concurrently, with one
instance of the compiler for each file.
This keeps each core of the processor occupied, so additional concurrency on top
of this may not improve the compilation time much.

However, Go's compiler implements compiling different portions of one file
concurrently.
\url{https://golang.org/doc/go1.9}.
It is a self-hosted compiler; it itself is written in Go.
This means it can benefit from the cheap concurrency that the language provides
in order to facilitate the concurrent compilation.

\subsection{Developmental Challenges} % Rohit

\subsection{Test Plan} % David

We will develop a test suite of example programs which encompass the features of
the P0 language. We will pull from the example programs in the notebooks, and
write our own.
We will also develop syntactically incorrect programs, or programs with type
errors, in order to test our error detection and reporting.

Using these programs, we will separately test each of the following components:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Scanner - Given the source code, is the expected sequence of tokens
    generated by the scanner?
  \item Parser - Given the tokens corresponding to the source code, does the
    generated AST correspond to the expected AST?
  \item Generators - \textbf{TODO:} I guess compare to the code generated by the
    original compiler for these languages?
\end{itemize}

We will also perform integration tests by running all the steps of the compiler
at once, ensuring that code generated by our compiler is identical to that of
the existing implementation.

In addition to the above, we will unit test the symbol table.
This particular program is more suited to unit testing than the other components,
because individual searches and additions can be made.
For the other components, an entire valid program is expected as input.

\subsection{Documentation} % Raymond - Godoc

For the documentation of our project we will be using GoDoc. GoDoc is similar to documentation 
generators for other programming languages, for example JavaDoc for Java and Doxygen for Python. 
GoDoc generates documentation in PDF or HTML format from comments in the source code. 
Following the standard conventions for GoDoc will provide easily readable source code and good 
documentation for all methods implemented in the P0 Compiler. GoDoc is chosen because it is the standard documentation standard for Golang, 
which is the main programming language we will be using for this project. The conventions for a standard GoDoc comment to generate HTML
 is easy to read, and alone would already provide readable source code to any viewer. 
 In conclusion, GoDoc is intuitive to use and similar to existing documentation standards we have experience with, 
 which makes it the perfect choice for this project.

\section{Resources}

\subsection{Transcompilation} % David

Python is generally an interpreted language, but Go is compiled before execution.
This means that the Go implementation of the P0 compiler would likely run
faster, even if no concurrency is used.
In order to get a fair comparison between the compilers, a few methods are
available.

The existing P0 compiler could be manually rewritten to Go.
This method will take a long time, and would leave less time for refining the
concurrent Go implementation.

Our preferred route is to transpile the existing Python code to Go instead of
manually translating the program.
Google offers a Python to Go transpiler called
\href{https://github.com/google/grumpy}{Grumpy}.

Another option would be to compile the Python P0 compiler and the concurrent Go
P0 compiler to a common language, then compare their run times in that 
language.
This is not ideal, because concurrency works differently between programming
languages.
Go is known for having very efficent concurrency compared to other languages.
As a result, the efficiency of the concurrent Go implementation may be
understated.
It would be preferable to use one of the previous two alternatives.

\subsection{Testing} % Raymond

For testing for errors in the P0 Compiler in Go, unit testing will be conducted. This unit testing will be done in the standard testing package that is
included in Go. This testing package also includes statement-based code coverage checking that will be useful as a metric for how well the code is tested.
The difference between this package and other standard unit testing for other languages such as PyTest for Python is that it does not utilize assert statements.
Instead an error is thrown after a boolean check coded by the programmer. This will allow the test package to detect multiple errors in the program, because
while an assert statement would stop the program after the first error, the test package in Go will instead detect the error and continue running other test cases.
In conclusion, using the Go test package we can eliminate errors in the sequential and concurrent implementation in Go before we test the differences in their runtimes
and answer the defined research question. \\    

For timing the execution time of the P0 Compiler, we can use a variety of different time libraries included in Python or Go. To be consistent, one timing library 
will be chosen
and used for testing the execution time of both implementations of the P0 Compiler. This will ensure 
accurate results to draw a conclusion from to answer the research question. How these libraries will be used for testing will be elaborated on in the Test Plan section.

Some inspiration from Pinterest for the poster board:

Overleaf has templates for poster boards as well.

Since golang implementes concurrency in its compiler, we can reference the
compilers code and documentation for the poster board.
